## Hey there 👋 My name is Philip!

### Who am I?
- 🌱 I love to code open-source and personal projects outside of work. This is where I learn and practice new tech to understand how it fits into enterprise-scaled ecosystems
- 🚄 I live in Japan 🏯 and love to explore the beautiful contrast of the big cities with the tranquil nature. Photography is often my excuse to motivate myself to explore

### What am I working on lately?
- 🔭 My current, open-source focused project is [find a doc](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-web)! Come join in!
